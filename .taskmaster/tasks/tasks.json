This plan formalizes its use.\n\n1.  Decision: We will use Server-Sent Events (SSE) as the primary mechanism for real-time data streaming. This aligns with the existing implementation and is a common standard for LLM APIs. WebSockets are not deemed necessary for the current scope.\n\n2.  Implementation:\n    *   Leverage Existing Code: The core logic in `openai_compatible.rs` for handling `InferenceOutput::Streaming` and preparing SSE events will be the foundation for all streaming endpoints.\n    *   Ensure Consistency: Apply the same SSE streaming pattern to any new endpoints that require it, ensuring a consistent developer experience.\n\n3.  OpenAPI Documentation:\n    *   File: `docs/api/openapi.yaml`\n    *   Action: For endpoints that support streaming (e.g., `/v1/chat/completions`), update the response definition. Add a `200` response with the `content` type `text/event-stream`.\n    *   Description: The description for the `text/event-stream` response will specify that the stream follows the OpenAI SSE format, where each event is a JSON object corresponding to a `ChatCompletionChunk`.
